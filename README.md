# Mongoose Social API
For this assignment, I have created a NoSQL database using MongoDB and Compass.  The user is able to Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete data from users, users reactions, friends, and reactions.  Using Insomnia, a user can easily navigate the database based on the URL endpoints while trying to manipulate their data.

## Objective

 - When the start command for the network API is invoked, then the server is started and the data is seeded.  The mongoose models and MongoDB database are synced.
 - When user opens Insomnia and choses the GET routes for users and thoughts, then the data for each of these is displayed in a JSON format.
 - When the user tests Insomnia for POST, PUT, and DELETE routes, then they are able to create, update, and delete users from the database.
 - When the user tests the POST and DELETE routes in insomnia for reactions and friends, then they are able to successfully create and delete thoughts and friends of a user.
